Objectives of the Exercise:

Apply t-SNE and UMAP to visualize complex datasets in 2D or 3D.
Compare the effectiveness of both methods in preserving data structure.
Understand how hyperparameters influence the results.

Expected Results:

t-SNE will likely produce clusters that highlight local relationships.
UMAP may provide a more global structure while maintaining local similarities.
The visualizations will help identify patterns, anomalies, or separations in the dataset.
